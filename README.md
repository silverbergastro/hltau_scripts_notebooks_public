### hltau_scripts_notebook_public

This is the public repository of finalized scripts and notebooks used to reduce and analyze data presented in Silverberg et al. (2024, submitted to AAS Journals). Scripts and notebooks are designed to read in and write out to local directories that are not committed here to minimize weight in repository.

Contents include:

-Python scripts for reducing and extracting data from Chandra observations (using CIAO)

-A makefile used to generate spectra, light curves, and images from XMM-Newton observations (using xmmsas)

-A notebook for looking at XMM-Newton and Chandra lightcurves, including identifying periodicity

-A notebook used to analyze best-fit values for model fits to spectra, specifically with regard to change over time across 20 years of observations, and observing the possible extent of periodicity

-A short notebook adapting the $Q$ parameter derived in [Cody et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AJ....147...82C/abstract) for X-ray data

-A short notebook plotting the spectral-fitting results from HL Tau against the spectral fits to sources in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project, presented in [Getman et al. (2005a)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJS..160..319G/abstract)
